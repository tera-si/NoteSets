            <p>
                NoteSets is a simple note-taking application that allows
                formatting of text, creation of note sets, saving and loading
                note sets, exporting individual notes or the whole note sets. By
                creating different note sets, the user can essentially group
                different notes together.
            </p>
            <small><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></small>
            <h2 id="new_notes">2. Taking New Notes</h2>
            <p>
                On startup, NoteSets contains two empty panels.
                <img src="images/startup.jpg" alt="NoteSets on startup">
                To start taking notes, select <span class="button">New</span>
                from the <span class="button">Note Set</span> menu to create a
                new note set.
                <img src="images/file_menu.jpg" alt="Note Set menu options">
                An editor will then appear in the right panel, and the
                application title bar will change to <span
                class="titleBar">NoteSets - Untitled - New</span>. You
                can now begin writing your first note.
                <img src="images/new_note_set.jpg" alt="Making a new note set">
                Once you have finished writing, press the <span class="button">
                Add As New Note</span> button at the bottom right, and
                the current note will be added to the Note Set View in the left
                panel.
                <img src="images/add_new_to_set.jpg" alt="Adding notes to the
                note set">
                The Note Set View shows you all the notes you created thus far,
                along with the date and time of their creation, and a preview
                text showing the first 120 characters of the note. The list is
                sorted in chronological order, hence the latest note will appear
                at the bottom of the list.
            </p>

            <h2 id="viewing_notes">3. Viewing Notes</h2>
            <p>
                To view a previously created note, select it from the list and
                its content will be displayed in the editor.
                <img src="images/view_note.jpg" alt="View created note">
                To write a new note when viewing an older note, delete all the
                text from the editor and you can start writing the new note. The
                notes are stored in the Note Set View, not in the editor,
                clearing the editor thus will not delete stored notes. <br>
                Both the editor and the Note Set View allow resizing for easier
                writing or preview. To do so, simply drag the middle divider
                left or right.
                <img src="images/resize_panel.jpg" alt="Resizing the two panels">

            <h2 id="editing_notes">4. Editing Earlier Notes</h2>
            <p>
                To edit a previously created note, select it from the list and
                edit its content in the editor. Once finished editing, click the
                <span class="button">Add As New Note</span> button to add the
                edited version to the list. The original version can be deleted
                if it is no longer needed.
            </p>
            <small><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></small>
            <h2 id="deleting_notes">5. Deleting Notes</h2>
            <p>
                To delete an existing note, select it from the list, then click
                the <span class="button">Delete Selected Note</span> button on
                the bottom left. You will be greeted with a confirmation prompt
                showing the preview of the selected note.
                <img src="images/delete_note.jpg" alt="Deleting a note from the
                list">
                Click <span class="button">OK</span> the the selected note will
                be removed from the list.
            </p>
            <small><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></small>
            <h2 id="saving_notes">6. Saving Notes</h2>
            <p>
                All changes made to a note set, i.e. new notes, edits, and
                deletions, will be lost on exit if remained unsaved. <br>
                To save the current note set, select <span
                class="button">Save</span> or <span class="button">Save
                As</span> from the <span class="button">Note Set</span>
                menu.
                <img src="images/save.jpg" alt="Saving the current note set">
                The current note set will then be saved as a single <span
                class="file">.noteset</span> file. <br>
                To prevent any data loss, if changes to the current note set
                were detected, you will be greeted a save reminder prompt before
                creating a new empty note set, loading another existing <span
                class="file">.noteset</span> file, or exiting the
                application.
                <img src="images/exit_prompt.jpg" alt="Save reminder prompt">
                If the editor is not empty, NoteSets will also prompt you to add
                its contents to the current note set before creating a new empty
                note set, loading an existing note set, exporting all notes, or
                exiting the application.
                <img src="images/uncleared_editor.jpg" alt="Prompt to add note
                when editor is not empty">
                If the editor is merely showing an earlier note that is already
                the current note set, you can safely ignore this prompt.
            </p>
            <small><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></small>
            <h2 id="loading_notes">7. Loading Notes</h2>
            <p>
                To load an existing note set, select <span
                class="button">Load</span> from the <span class="button">
                Note Set</span> menu, and choose your desired <span
                class="file">.noteset</span> file from the file chooser.
                <img src="images/load_set.jpg" alt="Loading an existing .noteset
                file">
                Once the note set has been successfully loaded, the title bar
                will change to <span class="titleBar">NoteSets -
                &lt;noteset_file_name&gt;</span>. For example, <span
                class="titleBar">NoteSets - lorem_ipsum.noteset</span>
                if the file <span class="file">lorem_ipsum.noteset</span> has
                been loaded.
            </p>
            <small><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></small>
            <h2 id="title_bar">8. Title Bar Status</h2>
            <p>
                The title bar also acts as a status bar that indicates the
                current status of the current note set. <br>
                <span class="titleBar">NoteSets</span> &mdash; The default title
                bar shown on startup. <br>
                <span class="titleBar">NoteSets - Untitled - New</span> &mdash;
                Signifying a new empty note set has been created.<br>
                <span class="titleBar">NoteSets -
                &lt;noteset_file_name&gt;</span>
                &mdash; Signifying the currently opened note set file. <br>
                <span class="titleBar">NoteSets -
                &lt;noteset_file_name&gt; - Edited</span> &mdash;
                Signifying unsaved changes (new note, and/or, note deletion) has
                been made to the current note set file. If the current note set
                is a new, unsaved note set, "Untitled" would be displayed
                instead of the filename.<br>
                <span class="titleBar">NoteSets -
                &lt;noteset_file_name&gt; - Saved</span> &mdash;

            <h2 id="exporting_notes">9. Exporting Notes</h2>
            <p>
                For greater note portability, you can export individual notes or
                the whole note set. <br>
                To export a selected note, first select it from the Note Set
                View, then select <span class="button">Export Selected</span>
                from the <span class="button">Export</span> menu.
                <img src="images/export.jpg" alt="Exporting a selected note">
                You will then be prompted with a message notifying "Exporting,

                please avoid editing, adding or deleting notes, creating,
                loading or saving note set, and exiting the application, to
                prevent errors. <br>
                Once the export is successful, you will be prompted with the
                success message and your selected note has been exported to a
                <span class="file">.html</span> file, preserving your text
